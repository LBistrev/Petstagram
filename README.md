# Petstagram

Creating a complete Django project called "Petstagram" throughout this course. The project will cover the following functionalities: creating a user profile; a user could view all photos of pets, open details, like a photo, edit and delete them.
Trought this workshop, we will be creating all the forms in the Django Project called "Petstagram". There are a "create", an "edit", and a "delete" form for a pet. A "create" and an "edit" form for the profile and a photo. The profile is deleted with a confirmation page, and a photo is deleted directly through the button "Delete".
Using Class-Based Views instead of function-based views and adding some admin functionality (admin views).
